A model for development of autonomous corporate governance systems based on synthetic data

The repository presents a model for development of autonomous corporate governance systems based on synthetic data. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first model to implement the concept of a dedicated operational context for autonomous artificial intelligence systems. The advantage of collegial governing bodies indicates that the creation of autonomous artificial intelligence systems based on combining the necessary functions will be a more promising direction than simply copying human behavior.
